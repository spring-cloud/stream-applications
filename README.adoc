== Stream Applications

In this repository, you will find a collection of components that can meet various data integration use cases and requirements.

The repository's primary focus is to provide a set of standalone Java functions that can be useful in the end-user applications as-is.

Besides, this repository builds on the Java functions to generate standalone Spring Cloud Stream applications that can run against Spring Cloud Stream's RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka binder implementations.
It is also possible to extend the generator to bundle the Java functions with the other supported binder implementations.

These applications can run standalone or as part of a data flow, such as the one orchestrated using Spring Cloud Data Flow.

=== Project Structure

The repository includes two major sections - `Functions` and `Applications`.
The former hosts the various Java functions, and the latter is for generating the standalone Spring Cloud Stream applications and hosting their related components.

The following are the various components of this repository.

=== Build

This build requires GraalVM JDK 17 distribution in order to build the script function and processor.

If you are building locally and don't want to publish to a repository set: `export LOCAL=true`

==== Quick Compile

This will compile all jars and publish to local repo.

[source,shell]
....
./quick-compile.sh
....

==== Boil the Ocean

This will build and test / integration test all the modules.

....
./full-build-test.sh
....

==== Core

This will build the core functionality and all functions.

[source,shell]
....
./build-core.sh
....

You can then build the desired apps.

==== Application

[source,shell]
....
./build-app.sh . applications/sink/log-sink
....

NOTE: In order to disable metrics by default there needs to be application properties configured like in `default-application.properties`. The `build-app.sh` script will copy default-application.properties into src/main/resources if no application.properties,yml,yaml or json is present.

=== Additional Resources

Here is a list of resources where you can find out more about using and developing functions and stream applications:
