== Stream Applications

In this repository, you will find a collection of components that can meet various data integration use cases and requirements.

The repository's primary focus is to provide a set of standalone Java functions that can be useful in the end-user applications as-is.

Besides, this repository builds on the Java functions to generate standalone Spring Cloud Stream applications that can run against Spring Cloud Stream's RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka binder implementations.
It is also possible to extend the generator to bundle the Java functions with the other supported binder implementations.

These applications can run standalone or as part of a data flow, such as the one orchestrated using Spring Cloud Data Flow.

=== Project Structure

The repository includes two major sections - `Functions` and `Applications`.
The former hosts the various Java functions, and the latter is for generating the standalone Spring Cloud Stream applications and hosting their related components.

The following are the various components of this repository.

=== Build

You can build everything from the root of the repository.

NOTE: The build depends on the global property `${revision}` to configure the current project version.
This value is resolved with the `maven-flatten-plugin`.
Because of this, you need to install some core poms in the local maven repository before running a build command.
To perform this necessary step, run `setup-build.sh`.

`./setup-build.sh`

`./mvnw clean install`

TIP: By default the build skips long running tests, annotated with `@Tag("integration")`,including tests requiring Testcontainers. To run the full test suite, activate the `integration` Maven profile:
`./mvnw clean install -Pintegration`. This applies to building functions or individual applications as well.

However, this may not be what you are interested in since you are probably interested in a single application or a few of them.

To build the functions and applications that you are interested in, you need to build them selectively, as shown below.

==== Building Functions

`./mvnw clean install -f functions`

You can also build a single function or group of functions.
For example, if you are only interested in `jdbc-supplier` and `log-consumer`, do the following.

`./mvnw clean install -pl :jdbc-supplier,:log-consumer`

==== Building Stream Applications Core

If you want to re-run the common core build, you can build it with the following.

`./mvnw clean install -f applications/stream-applications-core`

=== Building Stream Applications

Let's assume that you want to build a `jdbc-source` application based on Kafka Binder in Spring Cloud Stream and Log Sink application based on Rabbit binder.

Here is what you need to do.
Assuming that you already built both functions and stream-applications-core as above,

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw clean package -pl :jdbc-source
cd applications/source/jdbc-source/apps/jdbc-source-kafka
./mvnw clean package
----

This will generate the Kafka binder based uber jar in the target folder.

Similarly, for the `log-sink`, do the following.

[source,shell]
----
./mvnw clean package -pl :log-sink
cd applications/sink/log-sink/apps/log-sink-rabbit
./mvnw clean package
----

Rebuild all container images.

[source,shell]
----
./local/build-images.sh
----
