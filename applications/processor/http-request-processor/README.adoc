= Http Request Processor

A processor app that makes requests to an HTTP resource and emits the response body as a message payload.

== Input
=== Headers
Any Required HTTP headers must be explicitly set via the `headers` or `headers-expression` property. See examples below.
Header values may also be used to construct:

 * the request body when referenced in the `body-expression` property.
 * the HTTP method when referenced in the `http-method-expression` property.
 * the URL when referenced in the `url-expression` property.

=== Payload

The payload is used as the request body for a POST request by default, and can be any Java type.
It should be an empty String for a GET request.
The payload may also be used to construct:

* the request body when referenced in the `body-expression` property.
* the HTTP method when referenced in the `http-method-expression` property.
* the URL when referenced in the `url-expression` property.

The underlying https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/reactive/function/client/WebClient.html[WebClient] supports Jackson JSON serialization to support any request and response types if necessary.
The `expected-response-type` property, `String.class` by default, may be set to any class in your application class path.
Note that user defined payload types will require adding required dependencies to your pom file.

== Output

=== Headers
No HTTP message headers are mapped to the outbound Message.

=== Payload
The raw output object is https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/http/ResponseEntity.html[ResponseEntity<?>] any of its fields (e.g., `body`, `headers`) or accessor methods (`statusCode`) may be referenced as part of the `reply-expression`.
By default the outbound Message payload is the response body.
Note that ResponseEntity (referenced by the expression `#root`) cannot be deserialized by Jackson by default, but may be rendered as a `HashMap`.

== Options

The **$$http-request$$** $$processor$$ has the following options:

//tag::configuration-properties[]
Properties grouped by prefix:


=== http.request

$$body-expression$$:: $$A SpEL expression to derive the request body from the incoming message.$$ *($$Expression$$, default: `$$<none>$$`)*
$$expected-response-type$$:: $$The type used to interpret the response.$$ *($$Class<?>$$, default: `$$<none>$$`)*
$$headers-expression$$:: $$A SpEL expression used to derive the http headers map to use.$$ *($$Expression$$, default: `$$<none>$$`)*
$$http-method-expression$$:: $$A SpEL expression to derive the request method from the incoming message.$$ *($$Expression$$, default: `$$<none>$$`)*
$$reply-expression$$:: $$A SpEL expression used to compute the final result, applied against the whole http {@link org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity}.$$ *($$Expression$$, default: `$$<none>$$`)*
$$timeout$$:: $$Request timeout in milliseconds.$$ *($$Long$$, default: `$$30000$$`)*
$$url-expression$$:: $$A SpEL expression against incoming message to determine the URL to use.$$ *($$Expression$$, default: `$$<none>$$`)*

=== spring.codec

$$log-request-details$$:: $$Whether to log form data at DEBUG level, and headers at TRACE level.$$ *($$Boolean$$, default: `$$false$$`)*
$$max-in-memory-size$$:: $$Limit on the number of bytes that can be buffered whenever the input stream needs to be aggregated. This applies only to the auto-configured WebFlux server and WebClient instances. By default this is not set, in which case individual codec defaults apply. Most codecs are limited to 256K by default.$$ *($$DataSize$$, default: `$$<none>$$`)*
