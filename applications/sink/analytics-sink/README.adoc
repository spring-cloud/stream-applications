= Analytics Sink

Sink application, built on top of the https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/tree/master/functions/consumer/analytics-consumer[Analytics Consumer], that computes analytics from the input messages and publishes the analytics as metrics to various monitoring systems. It leverages the https://micrometer.io[micrometer library] for providing a uniform programming experience across the most popular https://micrometer.io/docs[monitoring systems] and exposes https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/spel.html#spel[Spring Expression Language (SpEL)] properties for defining how the metric Name, Values and Tags are computed from the input data.

The analytics sink can produce two metrics types:

- https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_counters[Counter] - reports a single metric, a count, that increments by a fixed, positive amount. Counters can be used for computing the rates of how the data changes in time.
- https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_gauges[Gauge] - reports the current value. Typical examples for gauges would be the size of a collection or map or number of threads in a running state.

A https://micrometer.io/docs/concepts#_meters[Meter] (e.g Counter or Gauge) is uniquely identified by its `name` and `dimensions` (the term dimensions and tags is used interchangeably). Dimensions allow a particular named metric to be sliced to drill down and reason about the data.

NOTE: As a metrics is uniquely identified by its `name` and `dimensions`, you can assign multiple tags (e.g. key/value pairs) to every metric, but you cannot randomly change those tags afterwards! Monitoring systems such as Prometheus will complain if a metric with the same name has different sets of tags.

Use the `analytics.name` or `analytics.name-expression` properties set the name of the output analytics metrics. If not set the metrics name defaults to the applications name.

Use the `analytics.tag.expression.<TAG_NAME>=<TAG_VALUE>`, property for adding one or many tags to your metrics. the `TAG_NAME` used in the property definition will appear as tag name in the metrics. The TAG_VALUE is a `SpEL` expression that dynamically computes the tag value from the incoming message.

The `SpEL` expressions use the `headers` and `payload` keywords to access messageâ€™s headers and payload values.

TIP: You can use literals (e.g. `'fixed value'`) to set tags with fixed values.

All Stream Applications support, ouf of the box, three of the most popular monitoring systems, `Wavefront`, `Prometheus` and `InfluxDB` and you can enable each of them declaratively.
You can add support for additional monitoring systems by just adding their micrometer meter-registry dependencies to the `Analytics Sink` applications.

Please visit the https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/2.6.0.SNAPSHOT/feature-guides/streams/monitoring/[Spring Cloud Data Flow Stream Monitoring] for detailed instructions for configuring the Monitoring Systems. The following quick snippets can help you start.

* To enable the Prometheus meter registry, set the following properties.

[source,properties]
....
management.metrics.export.prometheus.enabled=true
management.metrics.export.prometheus.rsocket.enabled=true
management.metrics.export.prometheus.rsocket.host=<YOUR PROMETHEUS-RSOKET PROXI URI
management.metrics.export.prometheus.rsocket.port=7001
....

* To enable Wavefront meter registry, set the following properties.

[source,properties]
....
management.metrics.export.wavefront.enabled=true
management.metrics.export.wavefront.api-token=YOUR WAVEFRONT KEY
management.metrics.export.wavefront.uri=YOUR WAVEFRONT URI
management.metrics.export.wavefront.source=UNIQUE NAME TO IDENTIFY YOUR APP
....

* To enable InfluxDB meter registry, set the following property.
[source,properties]
....
management.metrics.export.influx.enabled=true
management.metrics.export.influx.uri={influxdb-server-url}
....

NOTE: If the https://dataflow.spring.io/docs/2.6.0.SNAPSHOT/feature-guides/streams/monitoring/[Data Flow Server Monitoring] is enabled then the `Analytics Sink` will reuse the provided metrics configurations.
