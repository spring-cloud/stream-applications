# Websocket Supplier

A basic websocket supplier that produced messages through web socket.
The `Supplier` uses the `WebsocketInboundChannelAdapter` from Spring Integration.
This supplier gives you a reactive stream of messages and the supplier has a signature of `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.
Users have to subscribe to this `Flux` and receive the data.

## Beans for injection

You can import the `WebsocketSupplierConfiguration` in the application and then inject the following bean.

`websocketSupplier`

You need to inject this as `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.

You can use `websocketSupplier` as a qualifier when injecting.

Once injected, you can use the `get` method of the `Supplier` to invoke it and then subscribe to the returned `Flux`.

## Configuration Options

All configuration properties are prefixed with `websocket.supplier`.

For more information on the various options available, please see link:src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/supplier/websocket/WebsocketSupplierProperties.java[WebsocketSupplierProperties].
