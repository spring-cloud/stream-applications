# SFTP Supplier

This module provides a SFTP supplier that can be reused and composed in other applications.
The `Supplier` uses various `Sftp` inbound adapters from Spring Integration to support a range of modes to consume data from an SFTP server.
These include:

* Synchronize remote files to a local directory and supplying the File contents, the File reference, or a message per line.
* Stream remote file contents as a byte array directly without copying to a local directory.
* List the remote file names only.

Messages emitted by the supplier are provided as a byte array by default. However, this can be customized using the `--mode` option:

- *ref* Provides a `java.io.File` reference
- *lines* Will split files line-by-line and emit a new message for each line
- *contents* The default. Provides the contents of a file as a byte array


NOTE: When using `--mode=lines`, you can provide an additional option `--withMarkers=true`.
If set to `true`, the underlying `FileSplitter` will emit additional _start-of-file_ and _end-of-file_ marker messages before and after the actual data.
The payload of these 2 additional marker messages is of type `FileSplitter.FileMarker`.
The option `withMarkers` defaults to `false` if not explicitly set.

When configuring the `sftp.factory.known-hosts-expression` option, the root object of the evaluation is the application context, an example might be `sftp.factory.known-hosts-expression = @systemProperties['user.home'] + '/.ssh/known_hosts'`.

## Idempotency

By default the supplier uses a https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/metadata/SimpleMetadataStore.html[SimpleMetadataStore], storing the last modified time to track files that have already been processed in memory.
If an application using this supplier is restarted, any existing files will be reprocessed. You can inject on of the persistent https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/reference/html/meta-data-store.html[MetadataStore implementations] provided by Spring Integration, or your own of course, to maintain this state permanently.
See also link:../../common/metadata-store-common/README.adoc[`MetadataStore`] options for possible shared persistent store configuration for the `SftpPersistentAcceptOnceFileListFilter` used in the SFTP Source.


## Multiple SFTP Servers
This source supports consuming from multiple SFTP servers.
This requires configuring an SFTP Session Factory for each server.
The labels `one` and `two` shown below can be replaced by any names you want.
The following configuration will rotate between two SFTP servers (this can also be used for multiple directories on the same server), consuming files in a round-robin fashion:

```
sftp.supplier.factories.one.host=host1
sftp.supplier.factories.one.port=1234,
sftp.supplier.factories.one.username = user1,
sftp.supplier.factories.one.password = pass1,
...
sftp.supplier.factories.two.host=host2,
sftp.supplier.factories.two.port=2345,
sftp.supplier.factories.two.username = user2,
sftp.supplier.factories.two.password = pass2,
sftp.supplier.directories=one.sftpSource,two.sftpSecondSource,
sftp.supplier.max-fetch=1,
sftp.supplier.fair=true
```
---



`SFtpSupplier` is implemented as a `java.util.function.Supplier`.
This supplier gives you a reactive stream of objects from the provided directory(ies) as the supplier has a signature of `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.
Users have to subscribe to this `Flux` and receive the data.

## Beans for injection

You can import the `SftpSupplierConfiguration` in the application and then inject the following bean.

`sftpSupplier`

You need to inject this as `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.

You can use `sftpSupplier` as a qualifier when injecting.

Once injected, you can use the `get` method of the `Supplier` to invoke it and then subscribe to the returned `Flux`.

## Configuration Options

All configuration properties are prefixed with `ftp.supplier`.
There are also properties that need to be used with the prefix `file.consumer`.

For more information on the various options available, please see link:src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/supplier/sftp/SftpSupplierProperties.java[SftpSupplierProperties].
Also see link:src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/supplier/file/FileConsumerProperties.java[FileConsumerProperties].

## Examples

See this link:src/test/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/supplier/sftp/SftpSupplierApplicationTests.java[test suite] for the various ways, this supplier is used.

## Other usage

See this link:../../../applications/source/sftp-source/README.adoc[README] where this supplier is used to create a Spring Cloud Stream application that provides an Sftp Source.
