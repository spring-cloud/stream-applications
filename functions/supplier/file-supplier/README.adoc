# File Supplier

This module provides a File supplier that can be reused and composed in other applications.
The `Supplier` uses the `FileInboundChannelAdapter` from Spring Integration.
`FileSupplier` is implemented as a `java.util.function.Supplier`.
This supplier gives you a reactive stream of files from the provided directory as the supplier has a signature of `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.
Users have to subscribe to this `Flux` and receive the data.

## Beans for injection

You can import the `FileSupplierConfiguration` in the application and then inject the following bean.

`fileSupplier`

You need to inject this as `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.

You can use `fileSupplier` as a qualifier when injecting.

Once injected, you can use the `get` method of the `Supplier` to invoke it and then subscribe to the returned `Flux`.

## Configuration Options

All configuration properties are prefixed with `file.supplier`.
There are also properties that need to be used with the prefix `file.consumer`.

For more information on the various options available, please see link:src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/supplier/file/FileSupplierProperties.java[FileSupplierProperties].
See link:src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/supplier/file/FileConsumerProperties.java[this] also.

A `ComponentCustomizer<FileInboundChannelAdapterSpec>` bean can be added in the target project to provide any custom options for the `FileInboundChannelAdapterSpec` configuration used by the `fileSupplier`.

## Tests

See this link:src/test/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/supplier/file[test suite] for the various ways, this supplier is used.

## Other usage

See this https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/master/applications/source/file-source/README.adoc[README] where this supplier is used to create a Spring Cloud Stream application where it makes a File Source.
