# AWS S3 Supplier

This module provides an S3 supplier that can be reused and composed in other applications.
The `Supplier` uses the AWS S3 support provided by Spring Integration and spring cloud aws project
`S3Supplier` is implemented as a `java.util.function.Supplier`.
This supplier gives you a reactive stream of files from the provided directory as the supplier has a signature of `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.
Users have to subscribe to this `Flux` and receive the data.

## Beans for injection

You can import the `AwsS3SupplierConfiguration` in the application and then inject the following bean.

`s3Supplier`

You need to inject this as `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.

You can use `s3Supplier` as a qualifier when injecting.

Once injected, you can use the `get` method of the `Supplier` to invoke it and then subscribe to the returned `Flux`.

## Configuration Options

All configuration properties are prefixed with `s3.supplier`.
There are also properties that need to be used with the prefix `s3.common` and `file.consumer`.
