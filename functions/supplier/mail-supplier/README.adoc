# Mail Supplier

This module provides a File supplier that can be reused and composed in other applications.
The `Supplier` uses the mail IMAP and POP3 support from Spring Integration.
The `mailSupplier` bean is implemented as a `java.util.function.Supplier`.
This supplier gives you a reactive stream of emails from the provided url (imap or pop3).
The supplier has a signature of `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.
Users have to subscribe to this `Flux` and receive the data.

## Beans for injection

You can import the `MailSupplierConfiguration` in the application and then inject the following bean.

`mailSupplier`

You need to inject this as `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.

You can use `mailSupplier` as a qualifier when injecting.

Once injected, you can use the `get` method of the `Supplier` to invoke it and then subscribe to the returned `Flux`.

## Configuration Options
