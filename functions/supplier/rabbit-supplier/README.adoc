# RabbitMQ Supplier

This module provides an RabbitMQ supplier that can be reused and composed in other applications.
The `Supplier` uses the RabbitMQ support provided by Spring Integration.
The `rabbitSupplier` is implemented as a `java.util.function.Supplier`.
This supplier gives you a reactive stream of files from the provided directory as the supplier has a signature of `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.
Users have to subscribe to this `Flux` and receive the data.

## Beans for injection

You can import the `RabbitSupplierConfiguration` in the application and then inject the following bean.

`rabbitSupplier`

You need to inject this as `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.

You can use `rabbitSupplier` as a qualifier when injecting.

Once injected, you can use the `get` method of the `Supplier` to invoke it and then subscribe to the returned `Flux`.

## Configuration Options

All configuration properties are prefixed with `rabbit.supplier`.

For more information on the various options available, please see link:src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/supplier/rabbit/RabbitSupplierProperties.java[RabbitSupplierProperties].
Also see an auto-configuration for RabbitMQ connection and listener container options.

A `ComponentCustomizer<AmqpInboundChannelAdapterSMLCSpec>` bean can be added in the target project to provide any custom options for the `AmqpInboundChannelAdapterSMLCSpec` configuration used by the `rabbitSupplier`.

## Tests

## Other usage

See this https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/master/applications/source/rabbit-source/README.adoc[README] where this supplier is used to create a Spring Cloud Stream application where it makes a RabbitMQ Source.
