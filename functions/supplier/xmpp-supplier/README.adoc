# XMPP Supplier

A supplier that allows you to receive messages through a XMPP server.

## Beans for injection

You can import the `XmppSupplierConfiguration` in the application and then inject the following bean.

`Supplier<Message<?> xmppSupplier`

You need to inject this as `Supplier<Message<?> xmppSupplier`.

You can use `xmppSupplier` as a qualifier when injecting.

**NOTE:** This is a functional endpoint. One will need to subscribe to this endpoint in order to start accepting data
on it.
