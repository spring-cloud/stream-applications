# JMS Supplier

This module provides a JMS supplier that can be reused and composed in other applications.
The `Supplier` uses the JMS support provided by Spring Framework and Spring Integration under the covers.
`jmsSupplier` is implemented as a `java.util.function.Supplier`.
This supplier gives you a reactive stream from JMS sources. The supplier has a signature of `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.
Users have to subscribe to this `Flux` and then receive the data.

## Beans for injection

You can import the `JmsSupplierConfiguration` in the application and then inject the following bean.

`jmsSupplier`

You need to inject this as `Supplier<Flux<Message<?>>>`.

You can use `jmsSupplier` as a qualifier when injecting.

Once injected, you can use the `get` method of the `Supplier` to invoke it and then subscribe to the returned `Flux`.

## Configuration Options

All configuration properties are prefixed with `jms`.

For more information on the various options available, please see link:src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/supplier/jms/JmsSupplierProperties.java[JmsSupplierProperties].

A `ComponentCustomizer<JmsMessageDrivenChannelAdapterSpec<?>>` bean can be added in the target project to provide any custom options for the `JmsMessageDrivenChannelAdapterSpec` configuration used by the `jmsSupplier`.

## Examples

See this link:src/test/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/supplier/jms/[test suite] for the various ways, this supplier is used.

## Other usage

See this link:../../../applications/source/jms-source/README.adoc[README] where this supplier is used to create a Spring Cloud Stream JMS Source.
