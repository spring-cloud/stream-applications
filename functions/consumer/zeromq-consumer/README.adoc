# ZeroMQ Consumer

A consumer that allows you to send messages through a ZeroMQ socker.

## Beans for injection

You can import the `ZeroMqConsumerConfiguration` in the application and then inject the following bean.

`Function<Flux<Message<?>>, Mono<Void>> zeromqConsumer`

You need to inject this as `Function<Flux<Message<?>>, Mono<Void>> zeromqConsumer`.

You can use `zeromqConsumer` as a qualifier when injecting.

**NOTE:** This is a functional endpoint. One will need to subscribe to this endpoint in order to start accepting data
on it.

## Configuration Options

All configuration properties are prefixed with `zeromq.consumer`.

For more information on the various options available, please see link:src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/consumer/zeromq/ZeroMqConsumerProperties.java[ZeroMqConsumerProperties].
