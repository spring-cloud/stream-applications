# AWS S3 Consumer

A consumer that allows you to upload files to AWS S3.
The consumer uses the AWS S3 support from Spring Integration and Spring Cloud AWS.

## Beans for injection

You can import `AwsS3ConsumerConfiguration` in the application and then inject the following bean.

`Consumer<Message<?>> s3Consumer`

You can use `s3Consumer` as a qualifier when injecting.

There are also properties that need to be used with the prefix `s3.common`.
