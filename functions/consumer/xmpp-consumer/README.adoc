# XMPP Consumer

A consumer that allows you to send messages through a XMPP server.

## Beans for injection

You can import the `XmppConsumerConfiguration` in the application and then inject the following bean.

`Consumer<Message<?> xmppConsumer`

You need to inject this as `Consumer<Message<?> xmppConsumer`.

You can use `xmppConsumer` as a qualifier when injecting.

**NOTE:** This is a functional endpoint. One will need to subscribe to this endpoint in order to start accepting data
on it.

## Configuration Options

All configuration properties are prefixed with `xmpp.consumer`.

For more information on the various options available, please see link:src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/consumer/xmpp/XmppConsumerProperties.java[XmppConsumerProperties].
