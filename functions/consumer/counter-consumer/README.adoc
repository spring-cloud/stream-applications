# Counter Consumer

A consumer that allows to compute multiple consumers from an incoming message.
It uses micrometer internally and can use various popular TSDB technologies to persist the counter values.

It is worth to look at the https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/master/applications/sink/counter-sink/README.adoc[counter-sink] where this consumer is used to create a Spring Cloud Stream based counter sink.

## Beans for injection

You can import `CounterConsumerConfiguration` in the application and then inject the following bean.

`Consumer<Message<?>> counterConsumer`

You can use `counterConsumer` as a qualifier when injecting.

## Configuration Options

All configuration properties are prefixed with `counter`.

For more information on the various options available, please see link:src/main/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/consumer/counter/CounterConsumerProperties.java[CounterConsumerProperties].

## Tests

See this link:src/test/java/org/springframework/cloud/fn/consumer/counter[test suite] for the various ways, this consumer is used.

## Other usage

See this https://github.com/spring-cloud/stream-applications/blob/master/applications/sink/counter-sink/README.adoc[README] where this consumer is used to create a Spring Cloud Stream application where it makes a Counter sink.
