# Wavefront Consumer

This module provides a Wavefront Consumer that can be reused and composed in other applications.

## Beans for injection

You can import the `WavefrontConsumerConfiguration` in the application and then inject the following bean.

`wavefrontConsumer`

You can use `wavefrontConsumer` as a qualifier when injecting.

Type for injection: `Consumer<Message<String>>`

You can ignore the return value from the function as this is a consumer and simply will send the data to Wavefront.
