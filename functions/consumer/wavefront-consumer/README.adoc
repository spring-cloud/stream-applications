# Wavefront Consumer

This module provides a Wavefront Consumer that can be reused and composed in other applications.

You can use `wavefrontConsumer` as a qualifier when injecting.

Type for injection: `Consumer<Message<?>>`

You can ignore the return value from the function as this is a consumer and simply will send the data to Wavefront.
