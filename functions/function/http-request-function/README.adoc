# HTTP Request Function

This module provides an HTTP request function that can be reused and composed in other applications.
The `Function` uses the reactive `WebClient` from `Spring WebFlux` and is implemented as a `java.util.function.Function`.
This function gives you a reactive stream of `ResponseEntity` given a stream of request messages as the function a signature of `Function<Flux<Message<?>,Flux<ResponseEntity>>`.
Users have to subscribe to the returned `Flux` to receive the data.

## Beans for injection

You can import the `HttpRequestFunction` configuration in a Spring Boot application and then inject the following bean.

`httpRequestFunction`

You may inject this as `HttpRequestFunction`.

You can use `httpRequestFunction` as a qualifier when injecting.

Once injected, you can use the `apply` method of the `Function` to invoke it and then subscribe to the returned `Flux`.

## Configuration Options

All configuration properties are prefixed with `http.request`.
